# LIGHTS OFF


## -Overview
This lightweight web based experience was my first time developing a "game" like experience. The motivation behind this project was to explore
provoking feelings of stress via positional audio scattered throughout the game and playing with the users fight or flight response. The game was intentionally designed
to be unwinnable further stressing users out as it's not explicitly mentioned anywhere (lol). 

## -Instructions
You need Node.js to install the dependenciesn once you are the project folder open a terminal and run:

npm install

npx vite

It should start a local server where you can find the game hosted on!
