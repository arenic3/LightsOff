# LIGHTS OFF


## -Overview
This lightweight web based experience was my first time developing a "game" like experience. The motivation behind this project was to explore
provoking feelings of stress via positional audio scattered throughout the game and playing with the users fight or flight response. The game was intentionally designed
to be unwinnable further stressing users out as it's not explicitly mentioned anywhere (lol). 

## -Tech stack
This project was also a way for me to get into WEBGL thanks to Thee.js. I already have knowledge in OpenGL and basic computer graphics so why not take it further/apply it.
